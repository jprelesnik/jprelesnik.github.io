Jesse Prelesnik received his BS Biochemistry (2016) from Western Washington University (WWU) magna cum laude, performing undergraduate research under John Antos on the subject of sortase enzyme substrate recognition. He transitioned to computational science during this PhD Chemistry (at the University of Washington (UW), first under Lutz Maibaum receiving a rigorous education in statistical mechanics, molecular dynamics, and enhanced sampling strategies, and later under Jim Pfaendtner where he specialized in metadynamics biasing strategies and joined an Energy Frontiers Research Center (EFRC), the Center for the Science of Synthesis Across Scales (CSSAS). Within this program he did an internship at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and became co-advised by Chris Mundy, developing far-field electrostatic theories and extracting parameters from classical atomistic simulation results to explain differences in assembly behaviors of designed proteins from the lab of David Baker. After graduating in 2021, Jesse took a postdoctoral research position at the University of Minnesota (UMN) under J. Ilja Siepmann, developing an interest in porous adsorbent materials and expanding his simulation toolkit to include Monte Carlo (MC) methods, namely the Gibbs Ensemble (GEMC) and Transition Matrix (TMMC) varieities. Since 2024, Jesse has been a core postdoc at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in a combined experimental/theoretical effort alongside H. Chris Fry and co-advised by Henry Chan, who provides guidance on AI modeling to connect simulation results to experimental observations.
